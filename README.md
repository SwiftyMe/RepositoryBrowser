This Xcode project is a demonstration work, made to present my ability to work with SwiftUI in developing iOS apps. The app consists of mainly one screen that constitutes a GitHub repository browser with a simple detail repository view.

In software terms and generally speaking, the solution demonstrates my abilities to:

- write clean and readable code
- use standard software architectures and patterns such as MVVM, delegation and dependency injection
- construct presentable UI (although simple)
- write unit test using mockups etc.

Furthermore, it demonstrates my knowledge about and ability to work with specific technologies, such as:

- Swift, SwiftUI, Combine, HTTP request, JSON data, Git

Other things to mentions:

- A NavigationView is used to provide view navigation. To comply with visual design, navigation bars have been hidden.
- App project also include some unit tests to demonstrate the testable software architecture used.
- Almost every SwiftUI view in the project has a corresponding preview.
- As it is a demonstration work, only a subset of the available repositories is displayed (the fetch is page-based and only page 0 is retrieved)
